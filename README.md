This project is our third semester project **“Route Hive”**, a smart transportation management system built with React, Python, and SQLite. Route Hive is designed to digitalize and simplify university bus management by providing seamless features such as user enrollment, secure login, and role-based access. Administrators can add and manage buses, assign drivers, and accept or reject user requests, ensuring efficient transport management. Users can view their profiles and explore a real-time bus simulation, while drivers have dedicated access to their own profiles. With its clean design and practical features, Route Hive enhances convenience, transparency, and efficiency in managing transportation services.
